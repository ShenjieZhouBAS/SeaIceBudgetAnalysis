# SeaIceBudgetAnalysis
The sea ice budget analysis script are created by Prof. Paul Holland (BAS) to quantify the dynamic and thermodynamic processes governing the sea ice concentration. It was firstly used in Holland and Kimura, 2016 (https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0121.1). In this repository, the scripts used to pre-process wind, ice drift and sea ice concentration dataset, to compute the budget term are shared.
The budget terms are calculated with cal_budget.m script. Also included are the scripts using to read the Bootstrap sea ice concentration data (read_bootstrap.m), Pathfinder sea ice drift data (read_fowler.m). Note that sea ice concentration and sea ice drift data are not mapped onto the same spatial grid, and cal_concvelgrid.m is used to interpolate sea ice concentration onto sea ice drift grid. cal_fowler.m and cal_bootstrap.m computes the sea ice concentration and sea ice drift trend, seasonal mean.
